Setting up a WP8 Kirin app
==========================

Prerequisites:
-  Maven 3.1.0 or above (with the bin folder on your path)
-  MS Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone

Build the Kirin core jars

in Kirin\maven\kirin-archetype execute mvn clean install


Build your project's GWT target


Build the Kirin WP8 library 

This is done by executing rebuild_kirinkit.bat from within the Kirin folder


Create a new WP8 app in Visual Studio Express in the usual manner.

This should live in a wp8 folder at the same level as android, core, iPhone etc.


Add the Kirin WP8 library to your app

Unlike iOS, Windows and Windows Phone seem incapable of referencing libraries using a string containing a property.  If anyone else can find a way of importing %KIRIN_HOME%\core\wp8\KirinWP8\Bin\Debug\KirinWP8.dll then this should be preferred!

Until then, copy KirinWP8.dll into your project folder, and add a reference (right click References, choose Add Reference... then Browse).



Add the GWT target's app folder to the project

Add Pre-build event command line:

cd ..\..\..\..
wp8_prebuild.bat


And finally, put wp8_prebuild.bat into the wp8 folder and edit it to put your project's correct folder names in there.
